                Easy Way to Start Vote Pre-Registration
              </div>
              <div class="text-sm">
                Pre registration is one of the best ways to enforce your
                opinions and vote as fast as possible, as easily as possible. A
                voter must be registered 15 days before the election date making
                last minute registrations impractical and often leads to people
                forgetting to register before their 1st opportunity to vote.
                Pre-registration acts as a quick and easy way to finish your
                registration as soon as possible, with little to no added
                hassle.

                Take a few minutes out of your day to find your political
                stance. Acting as a great way of gauging one’s personal
                political stance, the political compass test is a quick
                questionnaire regarding a multitude of different types of issues
                and your own stance on them. The test is a great way to learn
                which parties your personal beliefs may align with, even without
                a strong understanding about different policies.

          <div class="text-sm text-[#201453]">
            Upon beginning the pre-registration process, you will need to select
            the “Pre-register to vote: for California residents age 16 or 17 who
            want to be future voters” option. Once the pre-registration process
            is in progress, you will be asked a few questions about your
            qualifications, personal information, identification, home and
            mailing address, and political party preference. If you would like
            to opt-out of choosing a political party preference, you will be
            able to do so. The next section of the application includes personal
            preferences and consent. You will be answering a few questions about
            how you want to receive your voter information, volunteer
            opportunities, and accessibility. At the end of this section, you
            will be affirming that everything you have filled out is true. After
            this, a page will pop up for you to confirm, review, and edit all
            the information that you have submitted. Once you have reviewed
            everything for any mistakes, you are all set and should be
            pre-registered to vote!
