A\n                voter must be registered 15 days before the election date making\n                last minute registrations impractical and often leads to people\n                forgetting to register before their 1st opportunity to vote.\n                Pre-registration acts as a quick and easy way to finish your\n                registration as soon as possible, with little to no added\n                hassle.\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"flex-1 bg-[#201453] ml-2 mt-2 flex flex-col items-center p-2\">\n              <div class=\"text-white m-2\">Welcome To Vote Pre-Registration</div>\n              <div class=\"text-white m-2 text-2xl font-bold\">\n                Political Spectrum Test\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"text-blue-500 m-2 bg-gray-100 rounded-full\">\n                <button class=\"w-40 text-center p-3\" onclick=\"location.href='https://www.politicalcompass.org/test'\">\n                  Test Now\n                </button>\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"text-white m-2 mx-6 text-sm\">\n                Take a few minutes out of your day to find your political\n                stance.

Once the pre-registration process\n            is in progress, you will be asked a few questions about your\n            qualifications, personal information, identification, home and\n            mailing address, and political party preference. If you would like\n            to opt-out of choosing a political party preference, you will be\n            able to do so. The next section of the application includes personal\n            preferences and consent. You will be answering a few questions about\n            how you want to receive your voter information, volunteer\n            opportunities, and accessibility. At the end of this section, you\n            will be affirming that everything you have filled out is true. After\n            this, a page will pop up for you to confirm, review, and edit all\n            the information that you have submitted.
